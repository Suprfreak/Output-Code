RPM packages are typically used by Red Hat-based Linux distributions such as Fedora and CentOS. Kali Linux is based on Debian and uses DEB packages instead of RPM packages. To install an RPM package on Kali Linux, you'll need to use a tool called `alien` to convert the RPM package to a DEB package. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a terminal and update your system's package list by running the command `sudo apt-get update`.
2. Install the `alien` package by running the command `sudo apt-get install alien`.
3. Once the installation is complete, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `zenmap.rpm` file.
4. Convert the RPM package to a DEB package by running the command `sudo alien zenmap.rpm`.
5. Install the converted DEB package by running the command `sudo dpkg -i zenmap.deb`.

This should install Zenmap on your Kali Linux system.
